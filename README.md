todo CodePath
===================

ToDo Android App

This is an Android Demo project for Pre-BootCamp CodePath work.

Time spent: More then I care to admit...

Completed User Stories:
 - Add To Do Tasks (Required)
 - Edit To Do Tasks (Required)
 - List To Do Tasks (Required)
 - Update and display To Do Task Status (Not Required)
 - Data Persistence (Required) - Coded but not functional

This turned out to be a fun project.
But I have to turn it in before midnight today without code cleanup.
There are a number of items that are definitely not best practice but do function.

***NOTE: I put the Add Task Button into the Action Bar***
